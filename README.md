# How to Run

## Windows

1. Download the `bmic_v4.0` file from the releases page.
2. Go to whichever folder you downloaded it to and run the app.

* If you run into issues with Microsoft Defender keeping you from downloading the app, report the issue here and I can send it up to Microsoft's security team to figure out the situation.
* If you do not want to wait to handle it that way, you can go to https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/add-an-exclusion-to-windows-security-811816c0-4dfd-af4a-47e4-c301afe13b26 for instructions on how to exclude the app executable.

## MacOS

* Unfortunately, I do not have a MacOS supported device in my possession. Therefore, I'm unable to make a .app file of this application for MacOS users.
* If you are willing to take the time for it, you can download the Source Code folder and convert the Python script to a MacOS application file.
  * Here's a website with instructions for how to do this with py2app on MacOS: https://py2app.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

## Linux

* Unfortunately, there's not a straightforward way that I know of to be able to make an executable version of this app for Linux distributions.
* If you are willing to take the time for it, you can download the Source Code folder and convert the Python script to an AppImage.
  * Here's an official repo with instructions for how to do this on Linux: https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit/wiki/Bundling-Python-apps
